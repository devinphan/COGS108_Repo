        "Founded in 1946, the National Basketball Association (NBA) stands as the premier professional basketball league in the United States and Canada, showcasing the world’s most elite athletes. However, the sport’s fast-paced, high-impact nature—with its explosive jumps, sharp cuts, and physical collisions—inevitably leads to injuries, even among the best players. Given basketball’s heavy demand on the lower body, we hypothesize that a player’s Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a calculation of weight relative to height, could influence injury risk. In our study, we will calculate the BMI for every NBA player from every season in the last decade and then find the mean or average BMI among all the players. Then we will categorize each player into the below average or above average BMI group. From there, we will use average BMI as a metric to determine if a higher BMI correlates to a higher risk of injury for professional NBA players that came from the last decade.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior Work\n",
        "\n",
        "One study conducted research on the main risk factors of getting injured in the National Basketball Association (NBA) League from the 2010-2011 season to the 2019-2020 (1). They determined risk factors based on data injuries, matches’ data, and players’ data. The study collected data from 1299 NBA players over ten seasons and every player was placed in one of seven player positions (center, center-forward, forward-center, guard, guard-forward, forward-guard, and forward) in order to gauge the playstyle of all players. Of all 1299 players, the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 24.91 km/m2. The study found that players of the center position were most vulnerable to getting injured according to the Cox regression model that calculates which factors increase a risk of injury. However, using another measure to determine risk factors for injury, like BMI, the study found that guards had BMIs furthest away from the average BMI, indicating these players were most prone to injury. This means that NBA players with a higher BMI were more susceptible to injuries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another study examined NBA players from 2015-2021 to identify risk factors for season-ending injuries (SEIs) (2). Analyzing 238 SEIs across 196 players, researchers found the strongest predictor was minutes played per game (MPG), with players averaging 20-29.9 MPG at highest risk. SEIs peaked late in the season, suggesting fatigue plays a key role. Knee injuries were most common (0.47 per 1,000 game exposures). Notably, BMI, age and position showed no significant association with SEIs. The findings highlight the importance of managing player workload, particularly by controlling minutes and addressing late-season fatigue, rather than focusing on body composition. Limitations included reliance on media-reported injury data and excluding injuries in a team's final five games.\n",
        "\n",
        "These two studies don’t exactly answer our research question if NBA players with a higher BMI average correlate with a higher risk of injury to NBA professionals (from the 2014-2015 season to the 2024-2025 season). The problem with the first study is that BMI was not the primary variable in the analysis of risk factors for getting injured in the NBA. Within the discussion of BMI, the study did not compare the chances of injury between players with low and high BMIs. Also, the timeline of the data collection does not match our interest as we want data from the last decade not only being limited to the 2014-2015 season to the 2020-2021 season.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second study found that minutes per game (MPG) was an associated risk to getting injured with no mention of BMI. Even then, on a surface level, the study did not analyze the correlation between some factor risk and chances of getting injured. Instead, the researchers focused on a statistical relationship between two variables rather than concentrating on one specific variable and its consistent statistical relationship with injury risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, these two studies have statistically significant results that unfortunately do not answer our question. As a result, we are here to find out whether a higher BMI correlates to a higher risk of injury for NBA professionals. We will find appropriate datasets to collect data for our question, generate clear data visualizations, and conduct analyses to come to a concrete answer."

This expectation is based on existing sports science suggesting that greater body mass, regardless of composition, places additional strain on joints and soft tissues during high-impact activities. While BMI does not differentiate between muscle and fat, it remains a reasonable proxy for analyzing the relationship between player size and injury risk in a professional basketball context."
